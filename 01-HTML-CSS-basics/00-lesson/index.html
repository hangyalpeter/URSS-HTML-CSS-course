        <p>
            Hetty King embodied the spirit of the King family and the town of Avonlea. Hetty's strong stand for
            tradition and the importance of family and community was reflected in her fierce resistance to change. Her
            traditional beliefs would often conflict with the inevitable changing of times, not only among her family,
            but with the world at the beginning of the twentieth century.
