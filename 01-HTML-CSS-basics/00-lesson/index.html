            <p>
                Hetty King embodied the spirit of the King family and the town of Avonlea. Hetty's strong stand for
                tradition
                and
                the
                importance of family and community was reflected in her fierce resistance to change. Her traditional
                beliefs
                would
                often
                conflict with the inevitable changing of times, not only among her family, but with the world at the
                beginning
                of
                the
                twentieth century.

            <h4>Head teacher</h4>
            <h5>Avonlea local school</h5>

            <p class="exp-desc">
                Hetty went to school to become a teacher and graduated from Queen's College. Her rival, Muriel Stacey,
                won the
                distinguished 'Gold Graduation medal' and became the Avonlea school teacher. After Muriel left Avonlea,
                Hetty took her
                position and taught with a strict disciplinarian method for many years.

                Arguably the single most important character in the series, Hetty King embodied the spirit of the King
                family and the
                town of Avonlea. Hetty's strong stand for tradition and the importance of family and community was
                reflected in her
                fierce resistance to change. Her traditional beliefs would often conflict with the inevitable changing
                of times, not
                only among her family, but with the world at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
